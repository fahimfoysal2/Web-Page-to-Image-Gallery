# Better Image Viewer - Chrome Extension

This is a Chrome extension that allows you to view all the images from a web page in a better way.

### Motivation
Wanted to read Vinland Saga II from a website, but I was facing some issues, like- images are larger in size, doesn't fit in screen, need to scroll, can't see the full image at a time, etc.

So I made this extension to view the images in a better way.
